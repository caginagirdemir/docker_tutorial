# Docker Engine

## Overview

Docker Engine is an open source containerization technology for building and containerizing your applications. Docker Enginer acts as a client-server application with:

- A server with a long-ruuning daemon process ```dockerd```.
- APIs which specify interfaces that programs can use to talk to and instruct (to give order) the Docker deamon.
- A command line interface (CLI) client ```docker```.

The CLI uses Docker APIs to control or interact with th Docker daemon through scripting or direct CLI commands. Many other Docker applications use the underlying API and CLI. The daemon creates and manage Docker objects, such images, containers, networks, and volumes.
